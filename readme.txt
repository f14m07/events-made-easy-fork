Manage and display events, memberships, recurring events, locations and maps, volunteers, widgets, RSVP, ICAL and RSS feeds, payment gateways support. SEO compatible.
             
== Description ==

Events Made Easy is a full-featured event and membership management solution for Wordpress and ClassicPress. Events Made Easy supports public, private, draft and recurring events, membership and locations management, RSVP (+ optional approval), several payment gateways (Paypal, 2Checkout, FirstData, Mollie and others) and OpenStreetMap integration. With Events Made Easy you can plan and publish your event, let people book spaces for your weekly meetings or manage volunteers and memberships. You can add events list, calendars and description to your blog using multiple sidebar widgets or shortcodes; if you are a web designer you can simply employ the placeholders provided by Events Made Easy. 

Main features:
* Public, private, draft and recurring events with custom and dynamic fields in the RSVP form
* Allow people to create events from the frontend using a specific shortcode
* Membership management with custom and dynamic fields
* Volunteer management for events (using event tasks)
* Attendance reporting for events and memberships if the rsvp or member qrcode is scanned by someone with enough rights
* Page and post content protection through memberships or via shortcodes
* Drip content via memberships
* People and groups with custom fields per person
* PDF creation for membership, bookings and people info
* Membership card or booking ticket can be sent as PDF via mail automatically, with optional QR code to scan for attendance/payment info
* RSS and ICAL feeds
* Calendar management, with holidays integration
* Several widgets for event listings and calendar
* Location management, with optional OpenStreetMap integration
* RSVP bookings with custom fields and dynamic fields, payment tracking, optional approval, discounts
* Protection of forms with internal captcha, Google reCaptcha or hCaptcha
* Templating for mails, event lists, single events, feeds, RSVP forms, ... with specific placeholders for each
* Lots of shortcodes and options
* Payment gateways: Paypal, FirstData, 2CheckOut, Mollie, Payconiq, Worldpay, Stripe, Braintree, Instamojo, Mercado Pago, Fondy, SumUp, Opayo
* Send mails to registered people, automatically send reminders for payments
* Automatically send reminders for memberships that are about to expire or have expired
* Mail queueing and newsletter functionality
* Mailings can be planned in the future, cancelled ... and can include extra attacments
* Multi-site compatible
* Several GDPR assistance features (request, view and edit personal info via link; delete old records for mailings, attendances, bookings)
* Fully localisable and already fully localised in German, Swedish, French and Dutch. Also fully compatible with polylang and qtranslate-xt (https://github.com/qtranslate/qtranslate-xt/): most of the settings allow for language tags so you can show your events in different languages to different people. The booking mails also take the choosen language into account. For other multi-lingual plugins, EME provides its own in-text language tags and takes the current chosen language into account.

== Changelog ==
= 2.5.28 (2024//) =
* Fix sorting multiple columns in the events overview if you selected 'date and time' as a column too

= 2.5.27 (2024/12/29) =
* More jtable styling fixes
* The action to clear the complete queue now cancels all ongoing and planned mailings and all individual mails too

= 2.5.26 (2024/12/25) =
* Paging fix due to typo

= 2.5.25 (2024/12/25) =
* The configured payment gateways were not showing as expected
* Make "Show all bookings" in people overview work again as expected
* Added a REST API call, in case you don't trust WP cron to process the queue. As an example, you can call:
  curl --insecure --user "username:password" https://localhost/wordpress/wp-json/events-made-easy/v1/processqueue/60
  ==> don't user --insecure for public sites, and change "https://localhost/wordpress" by your wordpress url
  ==> change the "username" by your user and the "password" by an application password generated in your WP user settings
  ==> "60" means the script can run at most for 55 seconds (=60-5, 5 being a safety measure). Never set this higher than your cron recurrence of course
  ==> set the timing option for queue processing to "not scheduled" in EME, so the two don't interfere :-) But in fact: it doesn't really matter: EME is resilient enough to cope with both at the same time (but better be safe than sorry).

= 2.5.24 (2024/12/22) =
* Some more table fixes (more logical resizing)
* Last release of 2024 :-)

= 2.5.23 (2024/12/18) =

* Fix a JS error in templates admin
* Keep current tab after actions in mailer menu

= 2.5.21 (2024/12/12) =

* Allow dynamic groups also as condition in the setting 'Require logged-in user to be in of one of the selected EME groups in order to be able to book for this event.'
* Added #_ATTENDANCEPROOF_URL placeholder, which generates a link that - when clicked - will generate a pdf if the booking attendance count was > 0. The pdf template can be set in the event attendance settings.
* The url to check for attendance is now nonce-protected, but old url's are still supported

= 2.5.20 (2024/11/24) =
* Some HTML fixes
* Make the option 'Attendees list ignore pending' work as advertised (only for the placeholders, not the shortcodes)
* Uploaded files were not always shown in the list of files per event/booking (because of extra "-" in the filenames)

= 2.5.19 (2024/11/20) =
* Family members form template can now also contain custom fields of type "member" (next to those of type "people")
* Fix membership update due to invisible required field

* eme_locations_map shortcode was parsing width and heigth wrong due to new code

= 2.5.17 (2024/11/14) =

* Fix the console error "Not allowed to navigate top frame to data URL 'data:'..." in some browsers when clicking the CSV export button

= 2.5.16 (2024/11/13) =
* Added some details/summary (accordion) open/close animations and open only 1 details at the same time by adding the name attribute
* For family-type memberships: enfore the presence of #_FAMILYCOUNT and only 1-time presence of both #_FAMILYCOUNT -a #_FAMILYMEMBERS
* Frontend submit js and php warning fixes
  
= 2.5.15 (2024/11/10) =
* Replaced the use of jquery-ui-tabs and jquery-ui-accordion by regular html5, css and a little bit of JS. This should speed up things
* Removed the use of jquery-ui-dialog in the frontend. Once jtable no longer needs it, it will be removed in the backend too
* Removed the use of jquery-ui-autocomplete
* Added option all_events to eme_simple_multibooking_form, so all events are selected to attend.

= 2.5.13 (2024/10/05) =
* Add generic placeholders #_USER_GROUPS and #_USER_MEMBERSHIPS
* Add list of todos for an event. Each passed todo will send a mail to the contact person so you can use this to plan your event and not forget things. Difference with tasks: volunteers can subscribe to tasks, not todos. The todos are just a list of things you don't want to forget.

= 2.5.12 (2024/09/17) =
* Fix a small check causing membership stats to not work as expected

= 2.5.11 (2024/09/16) =

* Added task formfield placeholder #_TASKHTMLID. This can be used in the tast formfield to e.g. enclose extra task info in a html-label in the task signup form format:
  #_TASKSIGNUPCHECKBOX <label for="#_TASKHTMLID">#_TASKNAME (#_TASKBEGIN - #_TASKEND) (#_FREETASKSPACES/#_TASKSPACES)</label> <br />
* reminder-options are lists of numbers but were converted to a single value when creating new events

= 2.5.10 (2024/09/05) =
* CLI tool can allow mail from everywhere: allowed_senders=ALL
* Allow 'value=' for some fs fields
* Fix deleting holiday lists
* 4 extra RSVP mail filters, so you can filter (=change) the pending booking text yourself when moving a booking from//to the waiting list:
    eme_rsvp_email_from_pending_to_waitinglist_subject
    eme_rsvp_email_from_pending_to_waitinglist_body
    eme_rsvp_email_from_waitinglist_to_pending_subject
    eme_rsvp_email_from_waitinglist_to_pending_body
  By default they have the same value as the pending mail/subject

= 2.5.9 (2024/08/26) =
* Fix some PHP warnings
* Fix payment method setting via FS submit if only payment method is defined

= 2.5.8 (2024/08/21) =
* New feature: pay for event submissions
* Event submissions can now send email to the person submitting (if logged in) and a defined contact person
* It's no longer needed to use #_CFCAPTCHA, #_HCAPTCHA, #RECAPTCHA. Just #_CAPTCHA is sufficient, since only one captcha is allowed and EME knows which one to use. If more than one captcha is configured, certain forms will use the first configured one.
* Action eme_ipn_fs_event_action added, executed after the submitted event is paid for (1 param: $event)
* Action eme_fs_submit_event_action added, executed after the event is submitted into EME (1 param: $event)

= 2.5.7 (2024/08/13) =
* The filterform placeholders #_FILTERWEEKS, #_FILTERMONTHS, #_FILTERYEARS now take 2 extra optional placeholders that indicate the number of week/months/years in the past and the future you want the scope to be. Example:
#_FILTERYEARS{5}{3} to create a year scope from 5 years in the past till 2 years in the future
#_FILTERYEARS{5} to create a year scope from 5 years in the past till the default scope count (taken from the eme_filterform shortcode) in the future
#_FILTERYEARS to create a year scope from now till the default scope count (taken from the eme_filterform shortcode) in the future
* The new FS form did not correctly noted down event start/end times

= 2.5.6 (2024/08/10) =
* Fix guest frontend event submit
* Fix redirection to event: if the submitted event is not public and a guest submitted it, we show the success message and don't redirect

= 2.5.5 (2024/08/07) =
* Frontend submit now supports generic EME placeholders and interprets shortcodes too
* New parameter for frontend submit: startdatetime=now. If used, the start date and time are by default set to
  the current date/time (as the old plugin did)
  Example: [eme_add_event_form startdatetime=now]
* Add a status to memberships, so you can put memberships as inactive

= 2.5.4 (2024/07/30) =

* Fix a typo causing custom field not to be rendered in the frontend add event form
* Make frontend submit also work when wysiwyg not activated
* Treat #_FIELD as #_PROP if a property with that name exists and no basic event setting (this in fact renders #_PROP a bit redundant, but since you need to look in the code to know all properties I'm going to leave it as is)

= 2.5.2 (2024/07/28) =
* Remove duplicate code from frontend submit
* Make sure the location id gets passed from frontend submit form (if selecting existing location), and latitude and longitude get added automatically

= 2.5.1 (2024/07/26) =

* The number of spaces for a task can now be 0 too. If that's the case, the description of that task
  will be used as a section header for the next set of tasks.

* Fix ical php warning

= 2.4.44 (2024/05/17) =
* Make #_IS_USER_IN_GROUP also work for dynamic groups
* Account for empty/forced from-email when inserting a mailing (the individual mails were ok, so it just caused a php warning)

= 2.4.43 (2024/05/09) =
* Correct direct adding of dynamic groups of people or members
* Added an option for exact search match for custom field searches (for dynamic groups too)

= 2.4.42 (2024/05/03) =

* Fix auto-approve payments if pending seats are not considered as free

* Check a borderline case for full events when a pending booking is being paid for
* Added a mail for the case when a payment arrives for a pending booking for an event with auto-approve active but the
  event is fully booked so the booking can't get approved automatically
  By default this mail will only be sent to the contact person (and is empty for the booker).
  The mail content can only be changed via a mail filter (see doc on eme_rsvp_email_text_xxx_filter and eme_rsvp_email_html_xxx_filter

  Takes 3 required arguments: person_id, template_id and membership_id. person_id can be #_PERSONID if used inside another shortcode (that then first replaces #_PERSONID with the required value and then the shortcode is interpreted)

= 2.4.34 (2024/03/10) =
* Fix a newly introduced bug if rsvp cutoff times were floating point numbers

= 2.4.33 (2024/03/08) =

* Slovak language contribution by Jozef Gaal
* Make sure no countries with double alpha-2 code and the same language can exist
* Correct the use of the setting "Limit event listing?" It was not working due to a wrong column name in the database query
* Show the people/members of a group when editing that group (and allow filtering/actions as if in the people/member section)
* Added support for event placeholders #_RSVPSTART{xx} and #_RSVPEND{xx}, next to just #_RSVPSTART and #_RSVPEND so you can format the layout to your liking ('xx' being the date/time format in php date notation)
